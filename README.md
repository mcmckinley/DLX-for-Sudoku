## Running on Custom Sudoku Files

To solve a custom Sudoku puzzle:

```
./dlx <filename>
```

### Input

* The file must contain NÂ² integers, where N is a perfect square (e.g., 4, 9, 16).
* Each line should contain N integers.
* Whitespace is ignored, so the puzzle can be formatted neatly.

## Output

* If a valid solution is found, it is printed to the console.
* If the puzzle has no solution, an error message will be displayed.
